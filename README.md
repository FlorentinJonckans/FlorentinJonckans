<h3 align="center">French Front & Back-End Developper - Web Designer</h3>

Hi there. I'm a 23 years old Front & Back-End Developper working from France. I have been attracted by computering since my high school days. During the last years, I've learned to program and get some graphic renderings through the use of various technologies such as:
- HTML / CSS
- Java
- Javascript
- PHP
- C++

I have a lot of interest in the following topics:

    Improving DX by building tools.
    Building web games (I'm also interested in building a collaborative game engine).
    Security
    Monitoring

I've been working with Node.js for over eight years. I am now focusing on creating content for French developers.
