Hi there. I'm a 23 years old Front & Back-End Developper working from France. I have been attracted by computering since my high school days. During the last years, I've learned to program and get some graphic renderings through the use of various technologies such as:
- `HTML / CSS`
- `Java`
- `Javascript`
- `PHP`
- `C++`

I've been working with `Angular.js`, `React.js`and `Vue.js` since my first use of frameworks. And now, I'm focusing on creating visual contents and websites for French customers.
